# CommandFTL

> An online text-based game that will connect you with different players through a network of web components representing universes and ships.

## Project planning

I have planned a total of 4 different MVPs to be developed, each one of them being an increment of the previous one.
All of these MVPs are represented with a milestone each, which are the following:

1. [Most basic combat.](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/milestone/2). This includes the capability of a player to join the game, keep their session and perform a very basic action of attack.
1. [Introducing Systems.](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/milestone/3). A set of basic systems and their functionalities will be introduced into each players ships, expanding the commands kit and adding interest to battles. Also, some extra actions such as repairs will be added as well.
1. [Advanced Systems and Management.](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/milestone/4). Extra and more advanced (or rather complex) systems will be added into the game. These systems and also new weapons will be obtained as a reward for defeating another player.
1. [World Environment.](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/milestone/5). Includes several environmental hazzards that affect a sector and random events such as wreckages, distress calls and other NPC interactions.

Each of the above milestones include some extra information about them in the description.

## User Stories

The next set of User Stories has been created an associated to the first milestone they correspond to. Some of them will be moved between different milestones.

1. [[US1] As a player, during combat, I want to make use of my Weapon Systems to attack and destroy my target.](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/issues/2)
1. [[US2] As a player, to make the game more interesting, I want my ship to have different systems that increase my possible actions during the game.](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/issues/4)
1. [[US3] As a player, during or after my ship has been under attack, I want to be able to repair the damages.](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/issues/7)
1. [[US4] As a plyer, after achieving a goal, I want to receive a reward](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/issues/12)

## Entities created

As a base for future development, I have created a few 'classes' with simple data structures and empty methods. These can be found at [cc.yaml](https://github.com/Anglepi/CommandFTL/blob/main/cc.yaml) file, indicating the path of each one of them in the 'entidad' key.
